<h1 id="what-is-gyro-control">What is Gyro Control</h1>
<p>‚ÄúGyro control‚Äù promises <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krQ_ggZcN1Q">mouse-like precision
without aim assist</a> by using very small movements of the controller
as input, almost always as an alternative to aiming with the right
analog stick. This is great for me, because I‚Äôve found that I never want
to play games at my desk with the mouse and keyboard when I‚Äôve already
been sitting at my desk on mouse and keyboard all day already. If I‚Äôm
going to play a game I want to relax, playing on the projector and a
controller.</p>
<p>Even if you like mouse and keyboard, this gives you another option.
It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs intuitive, people already jerk their controller around
while playing games, why not make that an input?</p>
<p>The best part is, if you own a modern controller, you can (probably)
try it without buying anything else.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-i-use-gyro-control">How Do I Use Gyro Control?</h1>
<p>Using Gyro controls requires two things. First, any controller with a
gyro sensor. Switch Pro controllers, Dualshock 4s, and DualSense
controllers all have gyro, many third party controllers like 8BitDo Pro
models do too. Notably, Xbox controllers do not.</p>
<p>Next, you need <em>some kind</em> of gyro controller support. Modern
consoles (not the Xbox) have pretty good gyro support. Counterstrike 2,
Fortnite, and Apex Legends, all support gyro. If you play primarily on a
console, the rest of the post won‚Äôt be relevant to you, stop reading and
just go try it out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, native gyro support mostly sucks. Games will support
one modern controller, like the DualSense, and completely break with
another, like the Switch Pro. Even when it doesn‚Äôt suck, the
implementation of gyro support isn‚Äôt standardized. Availability of
customization options is extremely inconsistent. Some games only support
one type of camera movement, some don‚Äôt have flick stick (we‚Äôll get to
this later). None of this matters because on Steam <strong>if the game
supports mouse and keyboard, it supports Gyro.</strong> Non-Steam games
can be added to your Steam library, allowing you to use Steam Input.
Outside of Steam you can use <a
href="https://github.com/Electronicks/JoyShockMapper">JoyShockMapper</a>
(free, more work) or <a
href="https://www.rewasd.com/releases/release-5.3.0">reWASD</a>, which
is a subscription service, but supposedly the most convenient and
feature complete.</p>
<h1 id="hybrid-gamepad-gyro-vs-using-mouse-and-keyboard-binds">Hybrid
Gamepad + Gyro vs Using Mouse and Keyboard Binds</h1>
<p>There is a hybrid approach where the game still behaves like you have
a gamepad oustide of letting you use gyro aim. At time of writing, this
doesn‚Äôt work well for me. I get weird little bugs, gyro doesn‚Äôt work,
the game gets very confused about whether you‚Äôre using gamepad or mouse,
instability, bugs. This is especially bad if the gamepad implementation
was a bit half baked, which it often is in older games. So I just map
everything in the controller to the equivalent default keyboard mapping
for the game. The downside of just emulating mouse and keyboard is you
lose button glyphs, so you‚Äôll see ‚Äúhit E‚Äù instead of ‚Äúpress A‚Äù. I don‚Äôt
care about this, some people do.</p>
<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<p>In Helldivers 2 without Steam Input gyro did not work. With Steam
Input the native support fought Steam Input‚Äôs configs and weird buggy
behavior was common. Mostly this meant my character staring into the sun
while being eaten by bugs / turned into a picnic table by
chainsaw-wielding robots while I fumbled with configs. So I instead
mapped everything on the controller to mouse and keyboard inputs and it
worked perfectly. By convincing the game you‚Äôre just using the default
mouse and keyboard, you get the best supported control scheme and you
can reuse your tuned personal gyro settings across games without having
to petition the devs for better support and feature parity with whatever
your favorite implementation of gyro is. Mouse and keyboard provides us
with a perfect interface already, why bother with native support?</p>
<p>I hear some people are good at making hybrid setups work, so I think
it might be worth trying the couple most popular Steam Community
layouts. I may update this later, but I haven‚Äôt tried a hybrid layout
yet that ‚Äújust worked‚Äù.</p>
<h1 id="i-dont-have-a-controller-which-one-should-i-buy">I Don‚Äôt Have a
Controller, Which One Should I Buy?</h1>
<p>I would caution against buying a third party controller unless you
want to deal with <em>even more</em> config finagling than you normally
have to with gyro. You might not get recommended layouts for Steam, your
OS might not recognize it the controller (or if you‚Äôre on Linux, you
might have to deal with üíÄ linux driver issues üíÄ). Stick with first
party hardware. If you‚Äôre crazy you could spend $200 on a DualSense
Edge. If you have an old DualShock 4 lying around, that could work too.
Outside of those, your options are the DualSense and the Switch Pro.</p>
<p>Reddit generally likes the DualSense. <a
href="https://youtu.be/CenJLOTGxLc?si=jUzV9cW4qZuQj_7o&amp;t=946">Youtuber
‚ÄúNerrell‚Äù found that the Switch Pro was a little more accurate</a>, I‚Äôve
seen a couple other people compare the modern options and find that the
Switch Pro is a <em>little</em> better. I own a Switch, so I bought the
Pro, and let me tell you, it does not have enough buttons. The DualSense
has the whole pad there to map gesture controls, and I get the
impression it generally gets better support. The Pro controller has no
inputs beyond what you would expect from an old 360 controller. That
being said, Steam Input gives us the ability to deal with the lack of
buttons. Creating mode switches (or layers? or I think they made a third
thing?) in order to access more binds when some button is held is good
enough. Steam also lets you do things like map clicking a button once to
one key, twice to another, and holding the button to a third, which is
pretty useful for making one button deal with, for example, diving for
cover (single tap), go prone (double tap), and crouch (hold).</p>
<p>Anyway, I bought the controller from Pink Gorilla, a local shop that
I‚Äôm always surprised is still chugging along, so I don‚Äôt want to return
it.</p>
<p>If you want a little more convenience and some more features, buy a
DualSense. If you want marginally more accuracy, get a Switch Pro
Controller. If you already own a Switch (which is more likely than
owning a PS5 if you consider their sales figures, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtG11pmBe3U">etc</a>), you might
as well get the controller compatible with it.</p>
<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>You could just settle for native support or Steam Community suggested
layouts (if any are present for your game), but you‚Äôll probably have to
configure some stuff yourself. There are a <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GyroGaming/comments/198wq0y/new_to_gyro_gaming_start_here_gyro_beginners_guide/">lot</a>
of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uSfda_-Rc">guides</a> out
there that go into great detail, so I‚Äôm going to trust those to be
better up-to-date comprehensive sources. Here I‚Äôm just going to hit a
couple very common changes you might make, or situations you might find
yourself in.</p>
<h2 id="flick-stick">Flick Stick</h2>
<p>This is probably the most important setting. Once you‚Äôve freed up
your right stick, you can use it to make very large movements (like
fully turning around) instantly rather than aiming. This is very useful,
as those large movements are kind of annoying otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="gyro-ratcheting">Gyro Ratcheting</h2>
<p>Ratcheting refers to the ability to disable the gyro briefly so you
can move the controller back to a neutral position without moving the
game‚Äôs camera. I often map this to my mode switch button.</p>
<p>For some reason, in Steam Input you don‚Äôt set a gyro disable
button,you set a gyro enable button (even if gyro is always on) and set
the behavior of the enable button to be disabling the gyro. Intuitive!
<a

<h2 id="sensitivity">Sensitivity</h2>
<p>You‚Äôre probably going to start with the sensitivity too low while
you‚Äôre getting used to it. This is fine. Eventually you‚Äôll probably get
tired of making big movements and turn it up.</p>
<h2 id="d-to-2d">3D to 2D</h2>
<p>For some reason Steam Input defaults to just using ‚ÄúYaw‚Äù, reading
input from how the controller is turned or tipped. You probably also
want to use ‚ÄúRoll‚Äù, which reads how the controller is ‚Äútwisted‚Äù as well.
If it makes sense to you that you should be able to turn the controller
so the top faces left when you want to turn left, use ‚ÄúRoll‚Äù as well.
Try out the settings, reading about them is very abstract, when you
actually try the different options you will immediately understand how
they work, and if you‚Äôre anything like me, one setting will seem
obviously right and the rest obviously wrong. If you want to read about
it anyway, <a
href="http://gyrowiki.jibbsmart.com/blog:player-space-gyro-and-alternatives-explained">here
you go</a>.</p>
<h1 id="tangent-about-tf2">Tangent About TF2</h1>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PJIqEX93vL8?si=sOfHWUPpjs1eLp4c">This
video</a> prompted me to look into gyro controls, naturally I tried to
make them work in TF2 first. The config shown in the video is available
and extremely popular, but it didn‚Äôt work for me immediately. The
inventory would open and then instantly close as if it was getting two
inputs. Long story short, disabling gamepad in settings seemed to did
nothing, console commands either did nothing or broke it, what worked
was finding the Xbox 360 controller config text file and commenting
everything out (deleting the contents would also work).</p>
<p>For anyone else running into this, the file lives at:</p>
<p><code>SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\TeamFortress2\tf\cfg\360controller.cfg</code></p>
<p>So, if you want to play old, exceptionally buggy games with half
baked features in a way that they were never meant to be played, you may
have to do this sort of thing.</p>
<h1 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion,</h1>
<p>If this guide convinced you to try Gyro controls, send me a message
on Github telling me how long you spent futzing with configurations and
I‚Äôll chuckle knowingly while shaking my head.</p>
