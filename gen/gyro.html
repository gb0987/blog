and Why Should I Care</h1>
<p>‚ÄúGyro control‚Äù promises <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krQ_ggZcN1Q">mouse-like precision
without aim assist</a>. This is great for me, because I‚Äôve found that I
never want to play games at my desk with the mouse and keyboard when
I‚Äôve already been sitting at my desk on mouse and keyboard all day. If
I‚Äôm going to play a game I want to relax, playing on the projector and a
controller. When I buy games without controller support, I basically
never play them. I assumed this meant I‚Äôd have to write off a lot of
games, but apparently you <a
href="https://youtu.be/PJIqEX93vL8?si=sOfHWUPpjs1eLp4c">can even play
Team Fortress 2</a> with gyro controls just fine.</p>
<p>Even if you like mouse and keyboard, this gives you another option.
And it‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs intuitive, people already jerk their controller
around while playing games, why not make that an input?</p>
<p>The best part is, if you own a modern controller, you can (probably)
try it without buying anything else.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-i-use-gyro-control">How Do I Use Gyro Control?</h1>
<p>Using Gyro controls requires two things. First, any controller with a
gyro sensor. Switch Pro controllers, Dualshock 4s, and DualSense
controllers all have gyro, many third party controllers like 8BitDo Pro
models do too. Notably, Xbox controllers do not.</p>
<p>Next, you need <em>some kind</em> of gyro controller support. Modern
consoles (not the Xbox) have pretty good gyro support. Counterstrike 2,
Fortnite, and Apex Legends, all support gyro. If you play primarily on a
console, the rest of the post won‚Äôt be relevant to you, just go try it
out, you don‚Äôt have to read the rest of this post.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, native gyro support mostly sucks. Games will support
one modern controller, like the DualSense, and completely break with
another, like the Switch Pro. Even when it doesn‚Äôt suck, the
implementation of gyro support isn‚Äôt standardized. Availability of
customization options is extremely inconsistent. Some games only support
one type of camera movement, some don‚Äôt have flick stick (we‚Äôll get to
this later). None of this matters because on Steam <strong>if the game
supports mouse and keyboard, it supports Gyro.</strong> Outside of Steam
you can use <a
href="https://github.com/Electronicks/JoyShockMapper">JoyShockMapper</a>
(free, more work) or <a
href="https://www.rewasd.com/releases/release-5.3.0">reWASD</a>, which
is a subscription service, but supposedly the most convenient.</p>
<h1 id="hybrid-default-gamepad-gyro">Hybrid Default Gamepad + Gyro</h1>
<p>Before I talk about this I should mention that there is a hybrid
approach where the game still behaves like you have a gamepad oustide of
letting you use gyro aim. At time of writing, this doesn‚Äôt work well for
me. I get weird little bugs, gyro doesn‚Äôt work, the game gets very
confused about whether you are using mouse and keyboard or gamepad, some
menus won‚Äôt open. This is especially bad if the gamepad implementation
was a bit half baked, which it often is in older games. So I just map
everything in the controller to the equivalent default keyboard mapping
for the game. The downside of just emulating mouse and keyboard is you
lose button glyphs, so you‚Äôll see ‚Äúhit E‚Äù instead of ‚Äúpress A‚Äù. I don‚Äôt
care about this, some people do.</p>
<p>I hear some people are good at making hybrid setups work, so I think
it might be worth trying the couple most popular Steam Community
layouts. I may update this later, but I haven‚Äôt tried a hybrid layout
yet that ‚Äújust worked‚Äù. Maybe this will change in the future! But for
now, I want to talk about my favorite approach.</p>
<h1 id="gyro-gamepad-as-mouse-keyboard">Gyro Gamepad as Mouse +
Keyboard</h1>
<p>In Helldivers 2, without Steam Input, gyro did not work. With Steam
Input, the native support fought steam input, and weird buggy behavior
was common. Mostly this meant staring into the sun while fumbling with
configs and being eaten by bugs / chainsawed / lasered. So I just mapped
everything on the controller to Mouse and Keyboard and it worked
perfectly. By convincing the game you‚Äôre just using the default mouse
and keyboard, you get the best supported control scheme and you can
reuse your tuned personal gyro settings across games without having to
petition the devs for better support and feature parity with whatever
your favorite implementation of gyro is. Reddit is full of people
begging some dev for some gyro feature, just lie to the computer
instead. Mouse and keyboard provides us with a perfect interface
already, why bother with native support?</p>
<h1 id="i-dont-have-a-controller-which-one-should-i-buy">I Don‚Äôt Have a
Controller, Which One Should I Buy?</h1>
<p>I wouldn‚Äôt buy a third party controller unless you want to deal with
<em>even more</em> config finagling than you normally have to do with
gyro. You might not get recommended layouts for Steam, your OS might not
recognize it (or if you‚Äôre on Linux, you might have to deal with üíÄ
linux driver issues üíÄ).</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre crazy you could buy spend $200 on a DualSense Edge. Outside
of that, your options are the DualSense, the DualShock 4, and the Switch
Pro.</p>
<p>Reddit generally likes the DualSense. <a
href="https://youtu.be/CenJLOTGxLc?si=jUzV9cW4qZuQj_7o&amp;t=946">Youtuber
‚ÄúNerrell‚Äù found that the Switch Pro was a little more accurate</a>, I‚Äôve
seen a couple other people test them and find that the Switch Pro is a
<em>little</em> better. Also, I own a Switch. So I bought the Switch
Pro, and let me tell you, it does not have enough buttons. The DualSense
has the whole pad there to map gesture controls, and I get the
impression it is better supported on some games. Maybe if I bought that
instead I wouldn‚Äôt have experience any weird issues and I wouldn‚Äôt even
have bothered writing this at all! But you can just create mode switches
in Steam Input (or layers? or I think they made a third thing?) in order
to access more buttons (provided you‚Äôre holding one), and it‚Äôs good
enough. Steam also lets you do things like map clicking once to one key,
twice to another, and click and hold to another, which is pretty useful
for making one button deal with, for example, my bindings for Helldivers
2: dive for cover (single tap), go prone (double tap), and crouch
(hold).</p>
<p>Anyway, I bought the controller from Pink Gorilla, a small local shop
that I‚Äôm always surprised is still chugging along, so I don‚Äôt want to
return it.</p>
<p>I tried to get an old DualShock 4 from a friend to connect to the
computer, but it would randomly disconnect, your mileage may vary
there.</p>
<p>If you want a little more convenience and some more features, buy a
DualSense. If you want marginally more accuracy, get a Switch Pro
Controller. If you already own a Switch (which is more likely than
owning a PS5 if you consider their sales figures, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtG11pmBe3U">etc</a>), you might
as well get the controller compatible with it.</p>
<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>You could just settle for native support or Steam Community suggested
layouts (if any are present for your game), but you‚Äôll probably have to
configure some stuff yourself. There are a <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GyroGaming/comments/198wq0y/new_to_gyro_gaming_start_here_gyro_beginners_guide/">lot</a>
of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uSfda_-Rc">guides</a> out
there that go into great detail, so I‚Äôm going to trust those to be
better up-to-date comprehensive sources. Here I‚Äôm just going to hit a
couple very common changes you might make, or situations you might find
yourself in.</p>
<h2 id="flick-stick">Flick Stick</h2>
<p>This is probably the most important setting. Once you‚Äôve freed up
your right stick from looking around, you can use it to instead allow
you to make very large movements (like fully turning around) instantly.
This is very useful, as those huge movements are kind of annoying
otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="gyro-ratcheting">Gyro Ratcheting</h2>
<p>Ratcheting refers to the ability to disable the gyro briefly so you
can move the controller back to a neutral position without moving the
game‚Äôs camera. I often map this to my mode switch button.</p>
<p>For some reason, in Steam Input you don‚Äôt set a gyro disable
button,you set a gyro enable button (even if gyro is always on) and set
the behavior of the button to‚Ä¶ disabling gyro? <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GyroGaming/comments/ug54tk/comment/i6xgli4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Credit</a></p>
<h2 id="sensitivity">Sensitivity</h2>
<p>You‚Äôre probably going to start with the sensitivity too low while
you‚Äôre getting used to it. This is fine. Eventually you‚Äôll probably get
tired of making big movements and turn it down.</p>
<h2 id="d-to-2d">3d to 2d</h2>
<p>For some reason Steam Input default to just using ‚ÄúYaw‚Äù, reading
input from how the controller is rotated or tilted. You probably also
want to use ‚ÄúRoll‚Äù, which reads how the controller is ‚Äútwisted‚Äù or
‚Äútipped‚Äù as well. If it makes sense to you that turning the controller
so the top faces left when you want to turn left, use ‚ÄúRoll‚Äù as well.
Just try them out, reading it is very abstract, but when you actually
try the different options you will immediately understand how they work,
and if you‚Äôre anything like me, one setting will seem obviously right
and the rest obviously wrong. But if you want to read about it anyway,
<a
href="http://gyrowiki.jibbsmart.com/blog:player-space-gyro-and-alternatives-explained">here
you go</a>.</p>
<h1 id="tangent-about-tf2">Tangent About TF2</h1>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJIqEX93vL8">that
TF2 video</a> I mentioned? That guy‚Äôs controller config is available,
and extremely popular! But it didn‚Äôt work for me immediately. TF2 has
really weird gamepad support as covered in that video, this caused me
issues. The inventory would open and then instantly close as if it was
getting two inputs. Long story short, disabling gamepad in settings
seemed to do nothing, console commands either did nothing or broke it,
what worked was finding the Xbox 360 controller config text file and
commenting everything out (deleting the contents would also work).</p>
<p>For anyone else running into this, the file lives at
<code>SteamLibrary\steamapps\common/TeamFortress2\tf\cfg\360controller.cfg</code></p>
<p>So, if you want to play old, exceptionally buggy games with half
baked features in a way that they were never meant to be played, you may
have to do some of that sort of thing.</p>
<h1 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion,</h1>
<p>If this guide convinced you to try Gyro controls, send me a message
on Github telling me how many hours you spent futzing with
configurations and I‚Äôll chuckle knowingly while shaking my head.</p>
